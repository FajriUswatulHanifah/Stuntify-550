# Summary
In an effort to overcome the urgent problem of stunting in Indonesia, the prevalence of stunting was 21.6 percent in 2020, still above the threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), namely less than 20 percent. President Joko Widodo has a target for 2024: to reduce the prevalence of stunting by 14 percent. Recognizing the multifaceted nature of stunting, we created Project Stuntify, a comprehensive initiative aimed at improving the health and development of children and toddlers. By utilizing technology through applications that are easy for parents to use, they can actively monitor and know their child's health and growth and development levels. Apart from that, this application can also provide food recommendations with proper nutrition. There is also a notification feature as a reminder for parents for child health checks and vaccinations. The innovations we create can be a strategy to reduce the prevalence of stunting and pave the way for a healthier and more resilient Indonesian generation.
